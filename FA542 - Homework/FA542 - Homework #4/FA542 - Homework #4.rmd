## Problem 1

Download daily price data for January 1, 1990 through November 1, 2023 of Microsoft stock from Yahoo Finance. You may use the quantmod package in R for this purpose.

#### a.

Is there any evidence of serial correlations in the monthly log returns. Use autocorrelations and 5% significance level to answer the question. If yes, remove the serial correlations.

#### b.

Is there any evidence of ARCH effects in the monthly log returns? Use the residual series if there are serial correlations in part (ii). Use Ljung-Box statistics for the squared returns (or residuals) with 6 and 12 lags of autocorrelations and 5% significance level to answer the question.

#### c.

Identify an ARCH model for the data and fit the identified model. Write down the fitted model and justify your choice of parameters.
