## Problem 1

Download daily price data for January 1, 1990 through November 1, 2023 of Microsoft stock from Yahoo Finance. You may use the quantmod package in R for this purpose.

#### a.

Is there any evidence of serial correlations in the monthly log returns. Use autocorrelations and 5% significance level to answer the question. If yes, remove the serial correlations.

#### b.

Is there any evidence of ARCH effects in the monthly log returns? Use the residual series if there are serial correlations in part (ii). Use Ljung-Box statistics for the squared returns (or residuals) with 6 and 12 lags of autocorrelations and 5% significance level to answer the question.

#### c.

Identify an ARCH model for the data and fit the identified model. Write down the fitted model and justify your choice of parameters.

## Problem 2

Use the following commands to simulate a two-regime $\text{TAR}(1)$ model with 400 observations

require(NTS)
set.seed(1)
phi <- matrix(c(0.8,-0.7),2,1)
m1 <- uTAR.sim(400, c(1,1), phi)
xt <- m1$series

#### a.

Obtain a time plot for the data and its sample autocorrelation function with 12 lags.

#### b.

Obtain a scatter plot for $x_t$ versus $x_{t-1}$ and draw a smooth line on the plot using loess local smoothing.

#### c.

Apply threshold tests to confirm the threshold nonlinearity of the time series.

#### d.

Build a two-regime TAR model for the series and write down the fitted model.
