## Problem 1 (50pt)

Suppose that the daily log return of a pair of securities follows the following model:

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
r_{1, t}=-0.05+0.1 r_{1, t-1}+0.05 r_{2, t-1}+a_{1, t} \\
r_{2, t}=0.1-0.1 r_{1, t-1}+0.3 r_{2, t-1}+a_{2, t}
\end{array}\right.
$$

where $a_t$ denotes a bivariate normal distribution with mean $0$ and covariance:

$$
\Sigma:=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0.4 & -0.1 \\
-0.1 & 0.2
\end{array}\right)
$$

Any matrix operations can be computed in R. If any formulas require infinite series, you may approximate using the first 5 terms.

#### a. 

 Verify that the return series ${r_t}$ is a weakly stationary process.

 *Hint*: The “polyroot” function can be used to find all roots of a polynomial in R and the “eigen” function can be used to find all eigenvalues of a matrix in R.
